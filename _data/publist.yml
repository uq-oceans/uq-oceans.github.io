- title: "Time of glaciation in eastern Kunlun Mountains- A missing LGM expansion revealed by 234U/238U comminution age"
  image: kunlun.png
  description: This study investigates the influence of glaciers on landscape evolution and climate interactions in the northeastern Tibetan Plateau using sediment analysis and the comminution age method. Findings reveal unusual glacier behavior during Marine Isotope Stages 3 and 4, with more extensive advances than during the Last Glacial Maximum, linked to reduced precipitation, and identify key events shaping the Golmud River valley, showcasing the unique dynamics of high-altitude mountain glaciers during global climate changes.
